- Rename `pc%`.
- Move the data from `decision_data$()` into numeric arrays.
- Move `csize_width_pixels` and `csize_height_pixels` to the library.
- Fix: Two groups can be allies of other.
- Improve `money_transfer` with menu or input, more information and
  better layout.
- Improve: Calculate valid options in `decision` before displaying
  them.
- Improve `center_for` and `center`: calculate the actual size of the
  text using the current `csize`.

- Use `print_l` instead of `print` when possible.

== 2017-10-08

- Improve `center`: use a backslash to mark the prefered split points
  in the text.
- Improve design of the treasure report.
- Improve: Choose the ammount to be transfered to Switzerland.
- Display something during the calculation of the possible allies.

- Remove `maybe_advice`.
- Shorten the wording about the money in the advice report. Remove "a
  la hacienda pública" or replace it with "al erario público".
- Improve wording of "sus tierras". Better yet: Add an additional
  wording to be used in the advice report.
- Remove the mark "(*)" from the descriptions of the presidential
  decisions. It means they can be taken more than once. Improve the
  interface instead. For example change the color of the decisions
  that have been taken, and remove them from the possible inputs.
- Use `data_use`.
- Rename `decisions%` and family. The decisions are only a part of the
  data, like petitions and events. Better yet: Separate data into
  three arrays.
- Change the term "revolution" to the more precise "rebellion".
